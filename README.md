## State exercise #3

- Recreate as much of the Apple notes application as you can with React.

- If you are unfamiliar with the notes application (or are not on a Mac), the features include:

    - A sidebar with a list of the notes
    - When you click a note, the full contents of the notes can be viewed an edited
    - A search bar that filters the list of notes as you type
